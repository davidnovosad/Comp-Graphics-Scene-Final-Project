# Comp-Graphics-Scene-Final-Project
This repository contains a final project from the CS-330 course at SNHU.

# How do I approach designing software?
Having no previous experience with OpenGL I learned a  lot of new design skills that helped me complete the project and further improve and extend my skillset. 
From a proper setup of libraries all the way to rendering a complete 3D scene with lighting, my skills improved drastically thanks to this course.
I followed a process that allowed me to fully understand separate project areas and then I combined all of the knowledge to create a project.
First, I learned how to set up the libraries and start up the project window. After that, I learned how to create simple 2D objects, apply color, and apply texture to them.
Then I learned how to create 3D objects, situate them in space, apply lighting to them, and combined it all in the final project.
Applying this chronological pattern with milestones and learning one area of the subject at a time is very useful and can be applied in a variety of different places.
I can apply it in my future work, courses at SNHU, or my hobbies.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I found that the best way for developing programs is the milestones. What I like about them is that you are slowly adding part after part and if something fails,
you can always go back to the previous milestone or you know where the issue is because the previous code worked as expected and the issue was introduced in your added code.
The iteration factor is an important part of developing a successful project. Being able to create multiple versions and iterate through them either to see issues, progress, or changes
is a crucial way how you can confirm that you are on a good track. It also eliminates the fatigue of having to work on the project for a long time right before the due date. You slowly add new things every iteration.
This eliminates the error factor.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualizations helped me understand how to create fully rendered 3D objects and scenes. This will be helpful in my further professional and educational development.
In my further persuasion of educational prowess, I will be able to create 3D objects for courses that require it. If I decide to look at the game development path, I will be able to create scenes and 3D objects.
This can also be applied in courses where visualization plays a big part, such as simulations. 
This will definitely boost the career skills that I can apply and further improve as it gives me a strong base in OpenGL graphical visualization. I like gaming and creating a simple game with graphics that I learned 
would be a great way to apply my newly acquired skills.
